# ROBOT-NAVIGATION
The Robot Navigation Using Backtracking program solves the problem of finding a path for a robot through a maze using the backtracking algorithm.

Working in Short:
Input: The user inputs the maze size and structure (0 for open path, 1 for wall).

Backtracking Algorithm: The robot starts at the top-left corner (0, 0) and tries to move towards the bottom-right corner (N-1, N-1) by exploring four directions: right, down, left, and up.

Movement: If the robot reaches an open path (0), it moves there. If it hits a wall or dead end, it backtracks by marking the current cell as unvisited and tries a different direction.

Solution Path: If the robot finds a path, it marks the path in the solution matrix (with 1s) and prints it. If no path is found, it prints "No solution found".

Key Steps:
Recursion: The robot moves recursively in all four possible directions.

Backtracking: If the robot encounters a dead end, it backtracks and explores other options.
